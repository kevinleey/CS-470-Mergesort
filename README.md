# CS-470-Mergesort
### Project 1 
Given n unsorted integers, we want the top k integers. No other information is given other than 0 < k < n.

We will be comparing merge sort and quickselect to see which algorithm would be better to solve this interview questions.

### Merge Sort Algorithm
The merge sort algorithm is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm. It divides an array into smaller arrays and sorts them.  Then, it merges the subarrays together to create one sorted array.  

Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm and is effiecient for sorting datasets which are extremely large.

The time complexity for merge sort is O(nlogn).

Use the mergesort.html to see the animated code we created to represent the merge sort algorithm.


### Quickselect Algorithm 

### Comparison

Based on the problem given, quickselect is a better algorithm to use compared to mergesort.
